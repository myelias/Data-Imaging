# Data-Imaging
This Code is created exclusively by Martin Elias. It takes an image and makes the image smaller by any integer factor. In essence, the new image has a smaller resolution than the input image. The new image becomes a "mosaic" of the old one used as the basis for creating a real life mosaic from LEGO "pixel" tiles. This project was coded in Python. Please read the comments on the main file to understand flow of algorithm.
